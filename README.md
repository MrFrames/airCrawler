# airCrawler
an airBnB crawler, with GUI interface, which gathers, filters and displays data from results of a given search criteria

Issues: crawler crashes at the end of crawling, was working before, perhaps a change to the airBnB website tags.

Todo:

> Fix crashing crawler
> Change date input method, calender, or at least change to DD-MM-YYYY instead of YYYY-MM-DD
> No progress if inputs not correct, currently just produces error in console
> Hover over input prompts/status bar prompts, showing proper input methods.
